Nicolas Barré, Edouard Lederer, Thibaut Madelin for Les Echos.","['Nordic region: an opportunity for Europe?', 'Interview with Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, Director and Chief Executive Officer of BNP Paribas -  by \r\nNicolas Barré, Edouard Lederer, Thibaut Madelin for Les Echos.', 'Category', 'Six days before VivaTech opens, the head of the leading French bank explains its digital strategy. In particular, faced with GAFA, he defends the bank’s LyfPay payment solution, developed with Crédit Mutuel and probably rolled out tomorrow with other major European banks. ', 'We did the groundwork between 2012 and 2016, and embarked on an industrial and commercial phase in 2017. We have decided to invest EUR2.7 billion by 2020 to ensure an accelerated digital transformation. It is only possible to plan developments or investments today if they are fundamentally linked to a purely digital customer experience. In the space of a few years, we have overhauled our universe completely. Our IT budget now exceeds EUR6 billion a year, which is considerable. ', 'The client is at the centre of our set-up. He wants us to provide the most relevant data to guide him – be this for savings management, treasury, investment advice, new uses, and so on – through an increasingly complex world, quite rightly so given the vast amount of data around.', ""In this context, we need to be very agile, but also perfectly secure. There is a technological challenge to all this. We all know the ‘public cloud’, which is a very open model with data accessible by almost everyone. But, in the banking world, our clients' data is private, apart from any usage on our part to enable them to get better advice."", 'Cloud technologies in our sector are being built, but these are private-public or hybrid clouds. They will have the power of a public cloud, with the security of private infrastructure. We are one of the only banks in Europe that already have a private cloud, which we developed alone; we are now developing the future hybrid cloud in partnership with IBM. ', ""You need to be in an open universe in order to be attractive to clients. You cannot tell the customer ‘you are entering the BNP Paribas universe with the bank's offers alone, period.’ On the contrary, we must be able to bring interconnected service offers with other players. This is what we are doing with the LyfPay payment solution, which has been developed in conjunction with Crédit Mutuel and which will probably be developed tomorrow with other major European banks with whom talks have just begun. Customers from a number of retail banners are now equipped with this solution. It is entirely possible now to join forces to develop multi-bank, multi-brand and multi-service universes. This is the principle of the ‘merchant gallery’, via an app, with many brands that customers want to patronise. "", 'Things are moving ahead much faster for corporate and institutional clients, as they are extremely familiar with these new technologies and uses. Over the past two years, we have witnessed a forced electronification of the entire capital markets universe. Trades are now processed, offered and activated through interfaces. Only products with very high added value require human intervention. All cash, swaps or currency flow businesses, notably, are automated. This transformation – together with the new rules introduced by MiFID 2, which more strictly regulate market trading activities – is changing the business profoundly. Against this backdrop, either we invest to achieve critical mass and thus be able to continue these business lines, or we haven’t done this early enough and will fall by the wayside. There will be increased selection between banks that have invested and those that have not. ', 'We will be much more like a technology company, a FinTech as it were, than we are today. The services offer will become extensive, with a multitude of ideas that may interest to us. These will be complementary service offers, which will generate different forms of partnerships. We will have to pay close attention to this point: we must not just carry out a successful technological transition. Above all, we will have to be close to the entire ecosystem, with technology enabling us to revisit the way the bank is set up. If third parties can better provide some non-bank businesses than we do, we will not hesitate to invest in value added technologies, as we have done in recent years (Gambit, Nickel, etc.). Likewise, for capital market activities, banks can co-invest in platforms to provide equity funding for interesting ideas.', ""The bank's business lines will become even more technological, and we will require more digital marketing experts, data scientists, and, of course, always more sales advisors. The latter remain key to our business because, at the end of the day, the services with the most added value lie in the advisory field. This is just as true for retail clients, with home loans for example, as it is for corporates, for M&A transactions. "", 'There are people you cannot bring into large organisations, as they are driven by an entrepreneurial spirit above all else. You have to work closely with the company they have created. Moreover, we are not there to onboard everyone. Our business is primarily to look at what’s happening outside, and if we see ideas that are successful in another ecosystem, we will forge the right partnerships with the entrepreneurs that have originated them. ', 'Ten years ago, a client came to a branch ten or twelve times a year on average. Nowadays, he only comes to see us once a year. Branches are increasingly becoming a place to acquire new clients and to provide added value services. This adaptation is going smoothly, as we have always managed career and staff development by investing heavily in these retail banking businesses. And what is striking is that our teams have very solid assimilation skills, and great enthusiasm for all these technologies.', ""The bank is, above all, a culture of transparency. What is right in one place may be wrong elsewhere. It is very important to understand what clients expect from you. In Continental Europe, it is clear that the data is personal. They cannot be used in any way we want, and they cannot be lost. We have always viewed our clients' data in the same manner as their savings, in other words, as their property. And we have never considered that we can use any of it for our own purposes, except as a means to guide them better. The customer expects a banking institution to offer products linked to his or her universe, such as savings or wet leases. Our offers are admissible and expected in these related universes. On the other hand, if we were to embark on a business that had nothing to do with the one we are in, we would not be legitimate. I doubt very much whether a bank would be successful in large-scale retail. "", ""Not in Europe, but in the US. And not in banking, but in the payment business. The rules, models, and ways of doing things are different. In addition, the banks’ performance in this digital space is already extremely strong. There are neobanks in Europe with many customers, but the key to this business is not just to have ‘numbers' of customers. "", 'I don’t think that we are competing head-to-head as you might imagine. GAFA have huge playing fields, in retail in the broad sense, in means of payment, etc. Banking is another business entirely; it requires capital, it means complying with regulations that are extremely demanding. These are sectors where the probability of having as high a return as GAFA do is excessively low. Recent experience shows, moreover, that it is not simple for those who venture into banking from another sector. ', ""We do not own our clients' payments, as you know. Our concern is that payments should be carried out by those who know how to do it the best. A contactless card is extremely efficient. Smartphone payments are extremely practical. It depends on the usage, the times of the day, and the commercial activity. The payments universe will become vaster and those who have invested in it will be able to gain market share. Ultimately, the real question is that of the demise of cash. "", 'We live in an open world, so our clients expect to find a number of features in our mobile applications, including Apple Pay. It’s a bit like private banking, if you just offer your own products, this is not only prohibited, but more importantly your clients go elsewhere. That said, contactless payment is truly unbeatable today. ', 'In the future, payments will make it possible to give merchants the real information, to bring added value, as the economic model for the transaction becomes commonplace and poorly remunerated. This value added payment is Lyf Pay. We will continue to develop such applications at the European level. European banks need to together propose solutions that make it possible to take full advantage of the best local infrastructures, such as the Carte Bancaire grouping in France. ', 'As a matter of principle, the banking system must be divided among a number of players for obvious reasons of security, and for size and interconnection. We will see notions of systemic risk in payments one day, as is the case for banks at present. Payment players will be told: ‘You are so important that you must set aside some capital in case you lose an hour of transactions.’ If you are a bank, these flows represent operational risk and hence capital requirements. This will be the turn of others soon. ', 'Fail-safe systems do not exist. The best, I think, take turns. The reality is that there will be an ever-increasing offer of technology. Some will integrate it faster than others, as the technology becomes more widespread and accessible to all. When you reach a certain scale, you can go back to the heart of this technology.', 'There are market shares that can be distributed or redistributed. But the technological world also has its vulnerabilities. We now have a cybersecurity budget of EUR400 million per year. Ten years ago, it was marginal. These new ecosystems require new approaches and new businesses to be created, and all of this is to be done as we go along, which means accidents are unavoidable from time to time. ', 'I believe that the banking industry is extremely strong in information systems. How many companies have IT budgets running into billions of euros! We have numerous highly-skilled teams. Simply put, we are perhaps a little more aware than others of the need for security and data protection. Sometimes we do not run the risk of launching innovations. There are players that have gone too far in the public cloud. They will have problems, in my view, if future regulation asks them to secure the data. In any case, it is very expensive, and digital banking, contrary to what some believe, is a costly operation that requires real investment.

Explanations.', 'Category', ""Growth is inclusive when it narrows social inequalities in a country or a group of countries. It's a way of comparing the growth of developed and emerging countries. It's the outcome of a model that not only calls for redistribution policies to reduce social inequalities in the near term, but also calls for the long-term development of all types of personal talents and skills: inequality is reduced by participating in growth and creating economic value."", 'Economic policies have to look at growth over a sufficiently long term to factor in demographic ageing and the rise in healthcare costs. Thanks to redistribution mechanisms, society has to help those in financial or educational need, e.g. by offering individual training to anyone who has lost their job. This may also include support for SMEs, young companies, startups, and funding R&D to stimulate innovation. Financial risk-taking has to be rewarded because it will encourage investment in businesses that will create value and keep talent in the country so it can thrive.', 'Photo : William De Vijlder', ""The OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) has been working on this for a decade. But there's heightened awareness of it now. Inclusive growth is now regarded as a necessity, considering that a model that does not take inclusion into account is doomed to failure. We now acknowledge that the concept of wellbeing includes more than just a country's headline GDP."", 'Many macroeconomic statistics show that social inequalities are increasing. The proportion of earnings accruing to labour, i.e., wages and salaries, has been dropping for years. Most people rely on their wages for a living, and have little or no investment income, while financial risk-taking is rewarded better, witness the staggering performance of Wall Street.', 'This development reflects the globalisation of technological development. Many businesses have enjoyed phenomenal growth creating massive value for their shareholders, sometimes in far-distant countries (the phenomenon of globalisation) and new types of activities (the phenomenon of technological development). We have also seen downward pressure on low and semi-skilled jobs, widening the wage gap between low-skill and high-skill jobs. ', ""Climate change is also a key factor that affects emerging countries first, as agriculture is structurally important for their economy. Their productivity is particularly affected by drought and floods, reducing the country's investment capacity, adversely impacting growth and productivity. It is essential to incorporate such disparities between countries when drafting development assistance policies in order to make emerging countries more resilient."", 'More and more countries are taking the concept of inclusion into account. I can cite Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden... in France, the Law of 13 April 2015 requires the government, in its annual report, to present economic, social and environmental indicators, as well as wellbeing indicators.

This is the theory backed by the project SoCa (Soil Carbon), supported by the BNP Paribas Foundation and coordinated by the Research Institute for Development (RID).', 'Category', 'Climate change is ramping up, despite the roadmap ratified in 2015 for the Paris Agreement. Global warming is progressing at a rate of 3°C to 5°C, well above the 2°C threshold set by COP 21. In France alone, the atmospheric temperature has risen 2.7°C over the course of 2018. We know the human cost of this trend. The UN anticipates up to a billion people being displaced through climate migration at the end of the 21st century. A few decades later, the global population is expected to decline by the same number, according to some projections, in light of the expansion of uninhabitable and even unlivable regions. Should we be discouraged by this alarmist picture? The solution, or secret weapon, may be right under our feet, according to IRD researcher, Tiphaine Chevallier.', '“Soil and agriculture have long been glaring omissions in international negotiations on climate”, she laments. Today, these aspects are receiving some much welcomed attention through the international initiative “4 per 1000: agricultural soils for food security and climate”, launched at the COP 21 in 2015 by the French Ministry of Agriculture. The concept: to increase the carbon storage capacity of soils by 0.4% (4 per 1000) annually. A genuine CO2 collector, soil could limit anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, today evaluated at 4.7 gigatons of carbon per year.', 'The amount of carbon stored in the first metre of cultivable soil is already double that contained in the atmosphere. Cultivated soil covers one-eighth of the planet’s surface and may be our last hope, considering that 20% to 35% of emissions produced by humans each year are stored in the soil. Although soil may be an important lifeline, the research emphasises that our first priority must be to limit our greenhouse gas emissions. ', '“Soil represents a wide range of different textures and biological activity”, highlights Tiphaine Chevallier. “It remains the foundation of our food supply. It also produces fibres. Finally, it plays a major role in regulating water and greenhouse gases. Without soil, all of these essential functions would be lost”. According to pedology, or the study of soil, it is half composed of water and air and a nearly equal proportion of minerals. Within the crevices, and primarily in the surface, living organisms form the remaining 5% of its composition. The combination of these components is what makes the stabilisation of carbon in soil possible. “Plants capture atmospheric CO2 through the process of photosynthesis before ultimately decomposing into the soil. Soil bacteria, protozoa and fungi contribute to this decomposition and, in turn, to the stabilisation of carbon in the soil. It is this decomposed organic material that forms the soil carbon stock”, explains Tiphaine Chevallier. “The more clay in the soil, the more carbon it traps. The higher density of carbon is concentrated in the first 20 to 30 centimetres, although carbon is also found deeper, depending on the soil type.”', 'It is thus here, in this strategic layer, that soil’s lifesaving storage capacity may be reinforced. “Keep in mind that soil also emits greenhouse gases”, reminds Tiphaine Chevallier. “Nevertheless, it is possible to promote biomass production and thus increase the volume of carbon stored, in other words, to ensure more input than output.” But how? Here, responsible agriculture is poised to play a critical role, which brings us to the aim of the SoCa project--led by some twenty researchers and young researchers who are either completing their theses or training in four African countries (Benin, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and Madagascar)--to define it within a family farming context and to quantify the carbon footprints. ', 'This agricultural model is referred to as agroforestry. Its tenet lies in the coexistence of arboricultural plantations, biomass generators, and traditional annual crops. By improving soil quality, this alternative to unfettered crops strengthens their absorption capacity. Tiphaine Chevallier cites, for example, the palm trees planted alongside cassava crops in Benin, the banana trees growing in the cocoa farms of Côte d’Ivoire, and the clove trees paired with upland rice in Madagascar, where the soil is known for its high clay content.', '“Agroforestry helps to store carbon in the soil as well as in the trees’ biomass (the trunks, branches and roots). In Madagascar, initial results indicate an annual storage rate of nearly 2 to 4 tonnes of carbon per hectare depending on the density of trees in the plot”, asserts the expert. “The organic material aggregates the minerals and reduces erosion”. Better preserved soil is embraced by the farmers involved, for whom agroforestry is synonymous with the diversification of their crops as well as their income, thus reconciling environmental conservation and profitability.', 'Praising the commitment of the African farmers involved in the SoCa project, Tiphaine Chevallier explains that there are challenges. “Organic matter is produced slowly and is therefore unable to serve as fertiliser immediately”. The use of fallow land would give extensively harvested soil a rest, but this remains an uncommon practice due to economic pressures on local stakeholders. “Finally, its storage capacity is not infinite”, as the expert correctly recalls. Soil is a resource. To ensure its future, humanity must stay committed to its priorities with regards to the climate.

Hugues Even, Chief Data Officer at Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB), decodes this true revolution.', 'Category', 'There are two types of Artificial Intelligence: strong and weak. Strong AI is the one capable of replacing mankind – that is to say – it can do everything, understand everything, and perhaps even have a conscience. This is the AI that forms the foundation of much science fiction literature. It is now being researched, but it is still theoretical and does not yet exist. At BNP Paribas, we aren’t interested in such research. The AI we are interested in is that used everywhere today, across all industries: “weak” AI. It is capable of accelerating and automating time-consuming and repetitive processes.', 'It is based on two techniques. First, supervised learning, which involves training a machine to perform a specific task by showing through examples and feedback how a human would do it. The second method is unsupervised learning, which means that the machine is able to learn by itself from data provided.', 'To illustrate these two approaches, one can observe the evolution of the famous AlphaGo software, developed by Google to take on champions of the highly complex game of Go. Until 2017, AlphaGo was trained using data from games already played, i.e. supervised learning. Then an unsupervised version of the software was unveiled, AlphaGo Zero. Knowing nothing more than the rules of the game, this new version played millions of games against itself, before winning every one of its official games.', 'Photo : Hugues Even', 'Currently, AI allows for automation of repetitive and basic tasks that do not require human intervention. Specifically, the idea is to allow employees to refocus their time on what they can do best. At BNP Paribas, for example, AI frees up time for our operators in the back, middle or front office so that they can be fully available for their exchanges with the client, performing complex analyses and making decisions. This pushes us to ask: “How can AI improve on what humans do best?"" or ""What organizational changes are needed to accommodate this new form of human-AI collaboration?""', 'We base ourselves on the principle that AI allows us to respond to the small problems of everyday life. No attempts are being made to develop projects on a colossal scale – projects of this type never end. Instead, we focus on automating daily tasks that meet the pragmatic needs of our clients.

Our internal translation engine can translate content from up to 15 languages. The tool allows us to preserve one of the primary interests of our customers: protecting their data, while producing translations that meet our expectations.', 'There are also many other use cases. Some of our teams need to extract tables from annual reports in order to comment on them. We have developed a solution which is able to extract that data and then to produce related comments (through Natural Language Generation or NLG). Detailed and substantive analysis is then provided by our experts.', 'Finally, a third project we are very proud of is our internal search engine, called SEARCH. Large organizations, such as ours, have many internal search engines, but often lack a single search engine, capable of making all knowledge available in one place, like Google.

My team and I work across all business units and departments within the BNL Group. Generally speaking, our goal is to try to get teams to adopt a customer-centric and test-and-learn approach.', 'Agile is known to be a methodology, but for me it is more than that. I see it as a mindset, a set of principles that guide you through the choices you make. At BNL, we promote this way of thinking internally as we believe it has many benefits, especially when it comes to developing new products and services for customers. One of its advantages is that it incorporates continuous integration and daily testing into the development phase, allowing the development team to address issues while they are still fresh. Also, it is incremental, which means you move one step at a time, thus, reducing the risks of error as you progress. In addition, what makes Agile so great is that it brings all stakeholders, including the customer, into one room. This proves to be incredibly efficient in terms of transparency, collaboration and decision-making.', 'Photo : Alice Tancorre', 'Yes, we also rely on design thinking, which is a common methodology used by designers to solve problems and find desirable solutions for customers. It draws upon imagination, logic and intuition to explore possibilities and create outcomes that will benefit the end user. What I like about it it’s that it really puts the customer at the heart of the process. They are involved, together with the other stakeholders, in all the workshops, focus groups and brainstorming sessions. ', 'It’s great because it really ensures we take into account and respond to all of their needs, at each step of the project. Also, just like Agile, the process is interactive and it allows us to go back if, for example, we feel like we need to return to the prototyping phase after we’ve done some testing. To put it simply, this is how design thinking works: you generate ideas, you prototype them, you show these prototypes to customers, you gather customers’ feedback and, if needed, you go back to the idea generation or prototyping phase. And you do this until you’ve found the perfect solution!', 'Just a quick recap of how it all started... At the end of 2016, the BNL Group introduced a new way of working, based on Lean and Agile practices and methodologies. The aim was to respond to new digital transformation challenges and, by doing so, reach the group’s 2020 business targets. This new way of working involved a greater collaboration between the IT department (which includes our team) and the business units; to encourage cross-sharing and, more generally, promote technological solutions, innovation and customer-centricity. On the operational side, Digital Labs, which are stable, cross-functional and autonomous ecosystems, were set up to work on the delivery of digital transformation projects. Each Digital Lab is specialised in one type of customer-journey and, within its area of expertise, it is responsible for developing products or services for end-users (either customers or employees). And this is when we come in! Our Agile and Lean Transformation team basically joins these Digital Labs to help them successfully deliver their solutions. For example, we recently joined a Lab to help the team develop a new portal for corporate clients, designed to assist them in their day-to-day tasks and allow them to do everything in one place; like check their accounts or pay their employees.', 'In the next few weeks, our team will join the Chief Transformation Officer teams. This restructuring aims at providing support to the bank’s general management. More precisely, our goal will be to help the different departments in defining strategies and implementing initiatives that will lead to BNL’s global digital transformation. Another objective, specific to the office I will be joining, is to disseminate a business culture, based on agility and customer-centricity, within all of BNL’s divisions. To do this, we will widely promote the adoption of collaborative methodologies, such as Agile and design thinking, but also encourage supportive leadership and the creation of value.', 'Alice Tancorre', 'One of my favorite anecdotes is about a project that happened last spring. My team and I were involved in the development of a new loan servicing process aimed at small and medium-sized businesses. To design this solution my team and I organized a workshop with all the stakeholders, from top management to operations, and together we analyzed the customers’ pain points and needs. And what we did was simply incredible... We accomplished in just one day what we would normally have done in 3 months! By facilitating communication and decision-making, we managed to create, in just a couple of hours, a whole new process for our customers, which was ready to implement. As you can imagine, we all felt pretty satisfied after this workshop! ', 'One of my managers told me one day that passion and curiosity are the most precious qualities you need in this job. I realised he was right. To succeed as an Agile and Lean Transformation Agent, you need to have a deep interest in customer service, strongly believe in the methodologies and tools you design, and always be on the lookout for ways of improving them. Also, if you ask me; I would say that, the ability to listen and to be empathetic are also key. Indeed, change can be difficult thing to accept for people involved, so you really need to pay attention to their concerns, try and step into their shoes, and see how you can help. At the end of the day, the biggest reward is when you see that you have made a difference for the teams you work with and the customers!', 'Imagine you drew a lion.

The outlook for inflation, against a background of global\nuncertainties, allows them to be patient in terms of policy', 'The IMF in its latest Global Financial Stability Report expresses\nconcern about how high debt levels weigh on the resilience when faced with significantly slower growth or higher borrowing\ncosts', 'This implies that Fed policy will not only be confidently patient but also patiently vigilant', '', 'Recent comments and analyses about the US show that the\nperspective drives the messages. Hence the messages are different,\nnot to say conflicting. President Trump argued last week that the\neconomy would climb like a rocket ship if the Fed would cut rates,\nadding that the central bank had slowed down the economy.\nConsidering that next year is an election year, it doesn’t come as a\nsurprise that politicians closely monitor the health of the economy. It is\nreminiscent of the famous line “it’s the economy stupid” from Bill\nClinton’s successful campaign against George Bush sr. for the 1992\npresidential elections.', 'From the perspective of the Federal Reserve, the focus is on meeting\nthe policy objectives. The minutes of the March meeting show that the\ncommittee members are quite relaxed about the economic outlook\nwith their projections pointing towards ongoing good growth (slightly\nabove potential), a low rate of unemployment and inflation which\nremains under control. Compared to December, their uncertainty\nabout the outlook hasn’t really changed although the risks of a pick-up\nof the unemployment rate and a decline of inflation have increased,\nbut only slightly so (see Ecoweek). The minutes also show that\nthe Fed staff is confident about the outlook: the first quarter slowdown\nshould be transitory and growth is expected to bounce back solidly in\nthe second quarter. Moreover, it considers uncertainty around its\nprojections to be in line with the historical average, whereas risks to\nthe outlook are roughly balanced. All in all, this leads to a central bank\nwhich is confidently patient: confident about the growth outlook but\nwaiting patiently before contemplating any new action on official rates.\nWhy hurry when inflation is stubbornly close to target and foreign\nheadwinds haven’t disappeared?', 'The minutes report that “A few participants observed that the\nappropriate path for policy, insofar as it implied lower interest rates for\nlonger periods of time, could lead to greater financial stability risks.\nHowever, a couple of these participants noted that such financial\nstability risks could be addressed through appropriate use of\ncountercyclical macroprudential policy tools or other supervisory or\nregulatory tools.” Moreover, “a few participants observed that an\neconomic deterioration in the United States, if it occurred, might be\namplified by significant debt service burdens for many firms.” A link\ncan easily be made with the IMF’s new Global Financial Stability\nReport, “Vulnerabilities in a Maturing Credit Cycle”. In this report the\nauthors point towards a US corporate credit cycle which appears to be\nat its highest point in recent history (though lower than in some other\ncountries); corporate debt is skewed towards lower-rated issuers;\nleverage is at cyclical highs in most ratings buckets. This has\nhappened, quite logically, against the background of prolonged\nmonetary accommodation and a global expansion. However, when\nthese cyclical support factors turn into headwinds, the implications of\nreduced resilience should manifest themselves: increased sensitivity\nto lower earnings or to an increase in interest rates, following a rise in\nthe corporate spread versus treasuries if recession risks were to\nmount. The extent of the downturn then becomes particularly\nimportant: “Although corporate balance sheets are strong enough to\nsustain a moderate economic slowdown or a gradual tightening of\nfinancial conditions, a significant deceleration in earnings growth or a\nsharp tightening of financial conditions could lead to a notable\ndeterioration in corporate credit quality.” One should also be\nconcerned about contagion effects starting from lower-rated issuers,\nwhich will suffer more from a deterioration in the macro environment.\nThis may end up impacting higher quality corporates as well, via their\nbusiness with financially constrained firms and a deterioration in their\nown funding conditions, with banks and investors turning more\ncautious across the board. The lagged effects of monetary easing to\ncounter such a tide, create a two-fold challenge for the Fed: avoiding\nto tighten too much when the environment still looks good and making\nsure to ease sufficiently quickly when the outlook worsens. The policyis not only confidently patient, it will also be patiently vigilant.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The Economic Research Department of BNP Paribas.', 'Share this page !', 'Tools', '', '', 'On March 7th  2019, the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition will celebrate the...']"

However,\nfocussing too much on the manufacturing sector holds the risk of ignoring what\nis happening elsewhere.

This was a major opportunity for retailers, the tourism sector and entrepreneurs, who were suddenly able to expand their online operations both locally and internationally in a secure manner. Afrimarket, one of Sub-Saharan Africa's leading e-commerce sites, also chose BNP Paribas’ online payment solution for its operations in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire. It already had a close business relationship with the Group after working with BICICI – Banque internationale pour le commerce et l'industrie de la Côte d'Ivoire, a Group subsidiary – to develop an innovative online consumer credit offer for the Ivorian market. The offer was a huge hit with the middle class."", 'By the end of 2018, the banks had sold more than 100 contracts and processed more than 5,000 payment transactions. The offer was further strengthened when the e-commerce payment solution was directly connected to various global platforms (tour operators, hotels and the events industry). In Q1 2019, the offer was expanded with the introduction of the Payfacile brand to support the launch of all new innovative payment offers in Sub-Saharan Africa.', ""In June 2018 the Group’s subsidiaries in Morocco (BMCIand BDSI) and Côte d'Ivoire (BICICI) organised a hackathon that brought together employees, students and startups towork on innovationssuch as “the branch of the future” and “the autonomous customer”. The winning projects had the opportunity to be incubated at the Cantine Digitale, the lab operated by BDSI (the Group’s IT subsidiary) in Casablanca. These startups, created with employees who took part in the hackathon, were then fast-tracked at LaFactory and will help the local banksimprove customer experience. The employees involved received training in innovation processes and will join the BNP Paribas community of champions."", 'As for 2019, a similar initiative will be set up in Q1 in Algeria byBNP Paribas El Djazairfor its employees and local entrepreneurs. During the year, BMCI, BICICI andBICISin Senegal will host the famousStartup BootCamp, a US startup accelerator that is a partner ofRCS, the Group’s subsidiary in South Africa. The banks will help the accelerator find the most promising startups in Africa. Together they will shortlist entrepreneurs during a Demo Day in Capetown.', ""BNP Paribas is also involved in financing projects with a social and environment purpose.In 2018, two intrapreneurs from BICICI (Côte d'Ivoire) took part in the People'sLab4Good programme launched by the Group to support employees with positive impact projects. The programme’s key initiatives involve creating an agricultural farm to help feed children via school canteens, and generating power for canteens and bank branches from plant waste. Both projects will be partly financed by the Group.

That allows me to keep a close eye on their activity and act as a reliable partner on a daily basis.', 'For me, the secret is maintaining a close connection with customers. To do that, you have to get to know them and stay in touch with them to learn more about their activity. One trick is to put yourself in your customer’s shoes.

Perhaps the most eye-catching is the 50\nbasis points downward adjustment of the projection for the federal funds rate,\nwhich is now expected to be at 2.4% by the end of this year and 2.6%\nthereafter, implying one rate hike in 2020.', 'Perhaps as a counterweight to these downward adjustments, during his\npress conference, Jerome Powell insisted repeatedly on the favourable\noutlook and the good fundamentals (employment growth, low level of\nunemployment, attractive levels of consumer and business confidence),\nwhilst adding that the data did not send a signal to change rates in one or\nanother direction.', 'According to the Fed Chairman “it’s a great time to be patient” when the\noutlook is favourable, inflation is under control and the policy rate is at a\nneutral level. Yet, it looks as if the repeated insistence on the need for being\npatient before contemplating the next move is interpreted by markets as\nreflecting an underlying concern about downside risks to the outlook. Projections pointing towards slowing growth and a moderate increase in the\nunemployment rate may contribute to this reading. As a consequence, as shown in the chart, the federal funds rate (inferred from the futures curve) is\nexpected to decline in the course of 2020. The curve was already downward sloping at the end of January but since then it has dropped an additional\n20 basis points for the second half of next year and beyond. Clearly, an upward shift remains a distinct possibility. It all depends on the data. However,\ngiven the guidance provided by the FOMC projections and the Fed Chairman, it looks as though the bar for ending up with a positively sloped federal\nfunds rate curve –which would imply that the market expects rate several hikes again-, is high.

Funds also include unlisted securities like solidarity funds, and the financing of real estate or infrastructure projects (with environmental impact criteria).', 'Rising demand has driven us to roll out an increasingly diversified offer.', 'Photo : Béatrice Verger', 'I’ve noticed that SRI is a topic that speaks to millennials. For this generation, it’s important to find meaning in their investments, rather than basing their decisions on financial performance alone. It is estimated that 15% of investors under 35 are likely to decline an investment if the fund or company is involved in questionable activities, compared with just 7% of their elders.This is a generation that lived through the 2008 financial crisis and experienced the impact of derivatives on the financial system.', 'It is now facing all the challenges linked to climate change and its social consequences. For all those reasons, ethical and environmental concerns play a central role in their decisions. Millennials are also changing their consumption methods just as much as their savings habits.', 'SRI is part of a major shift in attitudes. It has changed the way we think about finance and responds to millennials’ demand for meaningful savings vehicles that support businesses which have a positive impact on the planet.', 'This group is often more interested in a thematic approach and “impact investing”, rather than funds that follow a classic best-in-class model. Millennials want to know the concrete impact of their investment by supporting several different causes—75% of them believe their investment can have an influence on climate change. Funds like BNP Paribas Aqua, which invests solely in businesses working on water issues, are thus a popular option. But this generation is also keenly aware of social issues. Eighty-four percent of millennials believe that they can use their investments to fight poverty. Our BNP Paribas Social Business France fund, which supports business that have a strong social impact, and BNP Paribas Human Development, respond to this aspiration.', 'We work to be as transparent as possible in our approach to responsible investing. We measure the carbon footprint of our funds and publish annual extra-financial reports to account for our actions and their concrete impact.', 'Impact analysis is a concept that millennials care about more than their elders, because it allows them to measure their contribution to sustainability challenges. We also promote our climate strategy and concrete actionsto reach the target set by the United Nations of a maximum 2°C temperature rise by 2050. We have 14 funds bearing the SRI label, a French government certification that guarantees the proper management of these funds. These certifications boost our credibility, as well as customer confidence in our products.', 'I’m convinced that accounting for ESG criteria in all investment decisions will become the standard practice. Financial decisions cannot be detached from social and environmental challenges. Millennials are the pioneers of this trend because, among all investors, they are the least skeptical and the most interested in these investments. They are eager to sing the praises of these solutions among their networks. Over time, their savings capacity will grow. SRI is expanding not just with millennials but because of them, as well as their new attitude towards “consumer activism”.As asset managers, we now have a crucial role to play. Only if we identify and implement real and observable solutions today will millennials continue to place their trust in us and support us in this approach.
